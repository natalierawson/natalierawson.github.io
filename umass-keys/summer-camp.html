				<h2>Testimonials</h2>
				<blockquote id="summer-test-1">
					<p>Annie enjoyed the camp SO much (as did we).  Watching those kids learn what they could accomplish together in such a short time was wonderful.  And the three Dung Beatles singing is a priceless video....  You are some kind of magician. Thanks so much, Inga.</p>

				<blockquote id="summer-test-2">
					<p>Our daughter has LOVED the Keys for Kids summer program for the last two summers.  She has made friends and had so much fun learning the songs and practicing for the show.  At the end of the two weeks, we are always amazed at how much they have learned!</p>

				<blockquote id="summer-test-3">
					<p>Thanks for running the summer arts camp.  Chloe absolutely loved it.</p>
					<p>She's been to various camps, but this is by far her favorite.  She says next year she wants to do upside down fairy tale camp every week! Thank you, and we look forward to next summer.</p>

					<p>Our daughter had a wonderful time at camp! She looked forward to going every day.</p>
					<p>She loved the music, the play, the set making, the teachers, and yet she took learning her lines and songs very seriously. We were very impressed with the whole experience!</p>

				<blockquote id="summer-test-5">
					<p>My daughter's response of 'Excellent' to my daily question of 'How was camp today?' is exactly how I would describe our experience with the Keys for Kids summer camp. Inga and her staff do an amazing job with the children. My daughter learned about the violin, piano, guitar, singing and acting, just to name a few, all of which culminated in an amazing performance on the last day of camp. I doubt there is another camp that is as fun, organized and productive as the Keys for Kids summer camp. The student to teacher ratio is also very small. I will without hesitation sign my daughter up again next year. It truly is 'Excellent.'</p>
