					<h3>Premium Enhanced Vocal Program <span>(age 13 and older)</span></h3>
					<p>Do you have dreams of performing on stage? Perhaps you would like to develop the skills needed to be included in a select choral ensemble - or maybe you have ambitions to be cast in a musical! Would you love the chance to perfect a polished stage presence? Participants in the enhanced vocal program have the opportunity to approach their study with an additional focus of their choosing, be it anything from gaining the confidence to join an a capella group, to developing a strategic approach to auditions, to cultivating the ability to discover and embody the intricacies of a dramatic character.</p>
					<p>Students 7th grade and up are encouraged to audition for this program. As part of their 45-minute weekly lesson, students in this program will develop the skills needed to become a valuable ensemble artist, including solfege-literacy, sight-reading, ear-training, and the ability to recognize and function within harmonic structure.</p>
					<p>In addition to their private lesson study, students in this program will also have the opportunity to participate in monthly collaborative sessions with other students in the program. The monthly sessions will include informational seminars covering such topics as Music Theory for Choral Singers, Lyric Diction, Foreign Language Translation Strategy, Audition Techniques, Stage Movement, and Dramatic Character Analysis. Twice per trimester, students in this program will have the opportunity to perform informally to an audience of their classmates in a master class, accompanied by a collaborative pianist from our faculty. Participation in the studio class yields the opportunity to learn about different performing styles by observing other classmates, and the opportunity to both offer and receive constructive advice from both the instructor and fellow singers.
