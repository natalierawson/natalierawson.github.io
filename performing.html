				<section id="bio">
					<p>I graduated from The Boston Conservatory at Berklee in 2014 with a BM in Vocal Performance. During my time at school, I performed scenes from <em>Le Nozze di Figaro</em> (Marcellina) and <em>The Medium</em> (Mrs. Gobineau), as well as being cast in the school's production of <em>Die Zauberflote</em>. I also attended the Orfeo Music Festival in Vipiteno, Italy. Here I performed scenes from <em>Carmen</em> (Mercedes) and <em>La Rondine</em> (Lisette).</p> 

					<p>After graduating, I performed steadily around southern Massachusetts. I had a steady run singing with First Parish Church in Duxbury, serving both as a section leader for the senior choir and a featured soloist.</p>

					<p>In 2015, I joined The Tanglewood Festival Chorus. As well as yearly runs with The Boston Pops to perform their Holiday Pops programs under the direction of Keith Lockhart, I have greatly enjoyed joining the chorus in a wide variety of repertoire during the main season. One of my favorite performances was when I traveled with the TFC to Carnegie Hall to perform Prokofiev's <em>Alexander Nevsky</em>. </p>

					<p>In September 2019, I moved to Birmingham, UK, where I hope to integrate as a musician when it is deemed safe to perform after the COVID-19 outbreak. In March 2020, I began a remote not-for-profit singing project called <a href="https://www.castingcall.club/projects/ongoing-christmas-in-quarantine-caroling-with-ccc-2-22599745-079a-4a1a-a6e2-0a0299dc0ccb">Christmas in Quarantine</a> for those who may have wanted a little early holiday cheer in light of being thrust into the "new normal". Since then, it has been open to anyone of any level of musical training (or lackthereof) interested in singing carols. I have been in charge of management, admin duties, creation of practice tracks, and mixing the final product. We will be having a special Christmas release, featuring new music, an audio play, and a comic.</p>

					<p>In my spare time, I continue to work on classical and musical theater repertoire.</p>
