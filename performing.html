As well as yearly runs with The Boston Pops to perform their Holiday Pops programs under the direction of Keith Lockhart, Natalie has greatly enjoyed joining the chorus in a wide variety of repertoire during the main season. One of her favorite performances was when she traveled with the TFC to Carnegie Hall to perform Prokofiev's Alexander Nevsky. She has also performed A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn), "Dixi" (Kancheli), On the Transmigration of Souls (Adams), Reqiuem in D K.626 (Mozart), Symphony No. 2 Op. 14 "October" (Shostakovich), and Daphnis et Chloé (Ravel) with the chorus. </p>

In her spare time she is continuing to work on solo repertoire for opera, musical theater, and jazz. She is also hoping to branch into voice over work. She is excited to see what the future holds for her performance career! </p>
