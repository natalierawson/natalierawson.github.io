# Simple Front-End UI Test

This test has been designed with three simple tasks to assess basic UI development experience.

## Requirements

* Git
* Git Bash

## Instructions

1. Clone this Git repository.
2. Complete Tasks A, B and C outlined below.
3. Push your final code to your own public Git repository, or a private repository and providing @indejuice with access.

## Task A

Build a simple webpage using pure HTML & CSS code as depicted in the `/src/task-a.png` design mockup.

* Write your solution under the `/www` directory.
* All required image files are located under `/www/img`.
* Colour codes for the design have not been shared, you must extract the colours as part of this task.

You will be assessed on how well your webpage design resembles the design image.

## Task B

Following on from Task A, you now have to make the webpage responsive using pure CSS. A design mockup has not been provided for mobile displays, you must redesign/relayout elements for slim mobile views as you see fit.

You will be assessed on how well your responsive webpage is designed.

## Task C

Finally, using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, make the webpage interactive by adding a simple modal window of your own design. See `/src/task-c.png`. The UX flow is as follows:

1. User clicks on an item in the list
1. Modal window is shown with the item's title, image, description and price, including a 'Buy Now' button
1. User clicks on the 'Buy Now' button to close modal window

The item information must be dynamically filled by JavaScript, meaning the modal window must by default have no item information in it's HTML code, and only filled with the relevant item's information when one is clicked. If you wish, you're welcome to use jQuery or AngularJS.

You will be assessed on your JavaScript solution and the design of your modal window.
