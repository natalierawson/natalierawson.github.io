        <p>I'm a big fan of this product. As great as Version 11 was, I think this version is
         more realistic and responsive. It's not perfect. I found the controller system still 
         a bit too complicated. Muscle memory helps a bit, but it could still use some 
         improvement.
         </p>
        <p>But that's a minor complaint. Compared to other games on the market, this is a great game
         at a great price.
         </p>
        <p>The music I can take or leave. I know that some players really get into the sound track. To
         me it's a lot of noise and very repetitive. I recommend picking this game up, even if you own 
         Version 11. It's a substantial upgrade and well worth the price.
         </p>

        <p>The game is great when I have the ball and can drive to the rim or dish for the quick 3; but I hate 
         playing defense. The controls are difficult and unintuitive. Where's the fun when you go in for a jam and
         then see your opponent do the same to you because your feet are stuck in cement?
         </p>
        <p>And don't suggest that I go to Basketball Camp. That stuff sounds good but the tips and lessons don't
         translate well to game conditions.

        <p>I've been waiting for this release. It's a great game and you won't be able to stop playing. I would 
         recommend this game to the basketball fans, but really anyone can enjoy this one.

        <p>I was so looking forward to this release. I got about 10 games out of it and then my gaming console stopped reading
         the disk. The disk is clean and free of scratches. All of the other games are still working just fine.

        <p>It's fun but frustrating because you have to basically relearn all the controls and button combinations all over again. 
         Why did they have to change everything? The enhancements are only okay at best and distracting at worst. My son hates
         this release and just goes back to Version 11. Save your money and wait for Version 13 (which might be a lucky number
         for a change.)
