            <p>When a page author uses non-standard HTML, they need to take their reasons into account, as well as how to make the decision beneficial for everyone involved in the web development process. After all, they are taking a gamble both in the moment and years down the line.
</p>
        <p>There are good and bad reasons for using non-standard HTML. The short term advantages of using non-standard HTML can be tempting. Certain browsers are capable of using code that isn't widely spread yet, especially regarding support for CSS3 and HTML5 exclusive features. These capabilities are attractive, and in such cases, a page author might want to take advantage. However, they would need to account for coding options that would cover them for other and older browsers. They would also need to take measures when these browser-specific capabilities do become standard.</p>
        <p>In other instances, using non-standard HTML can just equate to using HTML that doesn't fall under the conventions of best practice. When this happens, though the cosmetic result may be achieved, only a small handful of those involved with the page come out on top. The page author would achieve their goals for the page on a superficial level, and seeing users would be able to use the site, provided measures for backwards compatability were taken. </p>
        <p>Everyone and everything else in the web development process would be alienated, though. Visually impaired, and otherwise handicapped users may not be able to get their screenreader to understand the page. Should another web developer step in to contribute to the page, they would have much more difficulty updating and maintaining it. Even the processing technology and the webpage itself are disserviced. Should the page author want to validate the HTML, they would be unable to because of the non-standard code. Their web page would also lose visability on the web, and thus, publicity. This is because search engines would have a harder time understanding and indexing the content hosted on the site.</p>
        <p>This conclusion is much like the message of a movie one might see in health class: With proper planning and a good reason, non-standard HTML can be a beautiful thing. Otherwise, if the author uses irresponsible non-standard HTML, nobody wins. </p>
