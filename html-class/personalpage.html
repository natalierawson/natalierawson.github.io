            <h2 id="job">Occupational/Educational</h2>
            <p>I graduated from The Boston Conservatory with a major in Voice Performance in 2014. At the start of 2015, I was accepted into the Tanglewood Festival Chorus.</p>
            <p>In the non-music world, I've been an instructional assistant for the past few summers, working with special needs children.</p>

            <h2 id="people">Close people and animals</h2>
            <p>Let's see... I gots a mom, a dad, a brother, and two cats- Clyde and Mimi.</p>
            <p>I currently have a boyfriend too! OMG. His name is Chris and he lives in the UK in Birmingham. We've been together for 3 years. I'm actually visiting him soon, which is why I'm grateful this course is online!</p>

            <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Music is kind of my main thing at this point, so on a certain level I wonder if I can list anything about it as a hobby. </p>
        <p>Aside from that, I mess around online a lot. I'm kind of immersed in online culture. God, I cringed typing that, but I think I can justify it. I think that a lot of the strange things you find online can be rooted in already established philosophical and artistic concepts. A lot of the memes you see today are very reminiscent of the Commedia dell'Arte, for example. On the other end of the spectrum, a lot of the bizarre and strange videos you find, I believe, echo the Dadaist period. Or so I tell myself to help believe it isn't all just a waste of time. Which would just be nihilism, so I'm covered. </p>
